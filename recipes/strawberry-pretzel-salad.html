            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                Mix together the pretzels, 4 1/2 tablespoons sugar
                and melted butter. Press into the bottom of
                a 9x13 inch pan. Bake for 10 minutes, or
                until lightly toasted. Set aside to cool
                completely.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a medium bowl, beat the sugar and cream
                    cheese until smooth. Fold in whipped topping.
                    Spread evenly over the cooled crust.
                    Refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes.

                <li>
                    In a medium bowl, stir together the gelatin mix and
                    boiling water. Mix in frozen strawberries, and stir
                    until thawed. Pour over cream cheese mixture in pan.
                    Refrigerate until completely chilled, at least 1 hour.
