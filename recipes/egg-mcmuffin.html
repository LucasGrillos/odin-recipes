            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                The egg mcmuffin is a meal introduced by the
                McDonald's corporation in 1972 by Herb Peterson.
                Peterson, who served as an advertizing executive
                and food scientist, asked then McDonald's president
                Ray Kroc to look at his sandwich. Kroc reacted
                favorably, characterizing it as "...a crazy idea"
                and "...a whole new area of potential business
                ...the breakfast trade."
            </p>
            <p>
                The standard McMuffin is composed of a slice of
                round ham, griddle-fried egg, and topped with a
                slice of cheese on a toasted and buttered English
                muffin. While the McDonald's McMuffin is rounded by
                a ring used to maintain the shape, ours won't need
                that
