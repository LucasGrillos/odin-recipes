        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            A gyro is a cooked meat dish, typically lamb or
            chicken, wrapped in pita bread, almost like a
            sandwich. The wrap can include other ingredients
            such as tomatoes, onion, lettuce, and tzatziki
            sauce. The meat is typically cooked on a vertical
            rotisserie and served hot.
        </p>

            The gyro trace its origins to Greece. Cutting
            slices off of stacked meat was first seen in Bursa,
            part of the Ottoman Empire, called the doner kebab.
            It was introduced in Athens by immigrants from
            Anatolia and the Middle East. The distinct Greek
            dish later become known as the gyro including the
            definitive tzatziki.
